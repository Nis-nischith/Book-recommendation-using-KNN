A mini-project on K- Nearst Neighbors.
The aim is to recommend users new books based on their ratings on the books they have already read. 
### How is it implemented??
A reader rates a book on a scale of 1-10. By using cosine similarity in KNN model we search for k nearest books which are positioned in multi-dimensional axis influenced by user's rating. Based on the reader's history of rating a new book is recommended.
